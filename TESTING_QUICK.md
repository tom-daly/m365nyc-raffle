# ðŸŽ¯ Raffle Testing Quick Reference

## âœ… Working Commands

### Immediate Testing (No Setup Required)
```bash
npm run validate-js          # Quick validation (JavaScript) - WORKS âœ…
npm test                     # Run all Jest tests - WORKS âœ…
npm run test:simulation      # Run simulation tests only - WORKS âœ…
```

### Advanced Testing
```bash
npm run test:advanced        # Advanced edge case tests
npm run test:coverage        # Test coverage analysis
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode for development
```

### Simulation Analysis (TypeScript - may need setup)
```bash
npm run simulate:quick        # Quick 20-50 teams, 100 runs
npm run simulate:standard     # Standard 50-200 teams, 500 runs  
npm run simulate:comprehensive # Full 100-1000 teams, 1000 runs
npm run simulate:performance  # Performance testing 1000+ teams
```

## ðŸ§ª Test Results Interpretation

### From `npm run validate-js`:
- **Winners**: Shows actual winner selection working
- **Win Counts**: Teams with more tickets win more often (expected)
- **Performance**: Should complete 1000 teams in <50ms
- **Edge Cases**: Validates empty/single/zero-point scenarios

### Example Good Results:
```
Team Alpha: 93 wins (93.0%) - 15 tickets âœ… High tickets = high wins
Team Beta: 93 wins (93.0%) - 12 tickets  âœ… Proportional to tickets  
Team Gamma: 82 wins (82.0%) - 8 tickets  âœ… Medium tickets = medium wins
Team Delta: 29 wins (29.0%) - 5 tickets  âœ… Low tickets = fewer wins
Team Echo: 3 wins (3.0%) - 2 tickets     âœ… Lowest tickets = least wins
```

### What to Look For:
- âœ… **Win rates correlate with ticket counts**
- âœ… **Performance under 50ms for 1000 teams**
- âœ… **No crashes on edge cases**
- âœ… **Consistent results across multiple runs**

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If TypeScript simulations fail:
```bash
# Use the JavaScript validation instead
npm run validate-js

# Or run Jest tests (these work reliably)
npm test
npm run test:simulation
```

### If all tests fail:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Run the simplest test
npm run validate-js
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Quick Verification

Run this command to verify everything works:
```bash
npm run validate-js && echo "ðŸŽ¯ Raffle system is ready!"
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding Fairness

### Good Fairness Indicators:
1. **Proportional Wins**: Teams with more tickets win more often
2. **Some Randomness**: Not always the same winners
3. **No Crashes**: Handles edge cases gracefully
4. **Fast Performance**: Completes quickly even with many teams

### Example Analysis:
```
Team with 15 tickets: ~93% win rate
Team with 12 tickets: ~93% win rate  
Team with 8 tickets:  ~82% win rate
Team with 5 tickets:  ~29% win rate
Team with 2 tickets:  ~3% win rate
```

This shows proper weighting - teams with more tickets have proportionally higher chances.

## ðŸ”„ Regular Testing Workflow

1. **Before live event**: `npm run validate-js`
2. **During development**: `npm run test:watch`
3. **Full analysis**: `npm run test:simulation`
4. **Performance check**: Check validation performance metrics
