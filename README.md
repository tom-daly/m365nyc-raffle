## 🎨 Customization

### Modify Round Configuration

Edit `src/hooks/useRaffleState.ts` to change point thresholds:

```typescript
const DEFAULT_ROUNDS: RaffleRound[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Round 1", pointThreshold: 0, description: "..." },
  { id: 2, name: "Round 2", pointThreshold: 250, description: "..." },
  // Add/modify rounds as needed
];
```

### Adjust Ticket Calculation

Modify the ticket calculation in `src/app/components/PrizeWheel.tsx`:

```typescript
const ticketCount = Math.max(1, Math.floor(team.Points / 100)); // Change divisor
```

### Customize Colors

Edit Tailwind classes throughout components or modify the prize wheel colors in `PrizeWheel.tsx`:

```typescript
color: `hsl(${(index * 137.5) % 360}, 70%, 60%)` // Adjust HSL values
```

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Adding New Features

1. **New Components**: Add to `src/app/components/`
2. **State Logic**: Extend `useRaffleState.ts` hook
3. **Types**: Update `src/types/raffle.ts`
4. **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS classes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### CSV Upload Issues
- Ensure your CSV has the exact column names: `Team`, `Points`, `Submissions`, `Last Submission`
- Points and Submissions must be numeric values
- Check browser console for parsing errors

### Display Issues
- Clear browser cache if styles appear broken
- Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
- Check browser developer tools for console errors

### Performance
- For large datasets (>1000 teams), consider pagination in DataTable component
- Prize wheel performance may degrade with >50 teams in final round
